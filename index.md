Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Background & Motivation

Our project is to find a set of models and parameters that would give precise predictions about a 
patient’s health situation: whether he/she is healthy, has been infected by COVID-19 or has 
been experiencing normal pneumonia.

### Data

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ColdCode0214/CS539/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
